      "review": "Books in Physics have usually the difficulty to show direct/indirect link to everyday life events and in particular to show relevance to famous or hidden applications in biology and agriculture. I find some interesting 'fill-in the gap' in this regard in this book. This is the reason I've purchased it This is being said as positive point standing for this book I do not hesitate to say that the writer could have been more aware of typing his text in more 'elegant way' that corresponds to the importance of his work, this high-end talent is missed. It can be improved in future versions of this nice book.",
